### Hey, I'm Ben 👋

I'm a 25 year old full-stack engineer & games developer

## ⚡️ Current

Currently working on building [RONIN](https://ronin.co/)

## 💎 Experience

I like to say that I am a full-stack developer, but I have most experience with frontend development, primarily [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). However for the past few years I have been focusing a lot more on backend development, primarily using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Following from this, I spent 4 years studying Computer Games Programming at [Staffordshire University](https://www.staffs.ac.uk/), focusing on low-level programming using [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/) & specializing on advanced graphics using industry standard frameworks such as [DirectX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directx) & [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/).
